Got moving just after 09:00, staying on the CV-50 we drove through Liria ans eventually on to the CV-25 to Olocav, Marines, Gatova and down to Segorbe. This turned out to be a lovely road climbing for 14km not too steep and ending with a great open descent into Segorbe, well worth revisiting for a cycle.

San Sebastion is a lovely city and would be well worth a return visit to explore it fully. The Aire (Urgull) was pretty good if a little vague on wither it was an actual Aire as we where the only vehicle here.

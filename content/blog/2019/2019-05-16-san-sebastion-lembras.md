Moved off around 10:00 heading for Decathlon to get a second wheel bag, that done and Lotti walked we set off proper with a quick detour on and off the payage.

The first 40km to Bayonne took for ever as it was wall to wall traffic and road works. Our coffee stop was in Saint-Geours-de-Maremne, the on to Lembras and the Aire de Caudeau arriving just after 18:00 and bagging the last spot.

Once Flo made the tea we walked Lotti through a forest to a Roman Bridge and back via the road and into the local bar where the band where finishing setting up, the noise they made wasn't bad a nice spot.

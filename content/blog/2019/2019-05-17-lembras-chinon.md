Woke to the sound of light rain and a cold 11c, got our stuff together and hit the road as the rain got heaver.

As we moved further north the rain came to an end and we stopped in a McDonalds for a coffee, and on we went stopping on the outskirts of Chinon for fuel and Groceries. Just after 16:00 we are sitting in the sun with a beer enjoying the peace and quite.

Saturday it rained all day, so we lazed around showered etc and finally went for a walk after tea.

Sunday was much improved weather wise and the Brocante (Antiques Market) was on which we though would be worth a look and it was plenty of things to buy, unlike the market in Monseratt.

Monday and we risked a spin on the railway line to Richelieu where we managed a coffee before cycling back via the main road just getting back before the rain.

Lotti had a 09:30 with the vet, once that was done we called into the campingcar shop for a look bought a bin and some toilet chemicals.

Stopped in St Loup du Dorat for coffee and cakes, then on to Brehal.
This time the bars where open and we had a couple of beers still no food. After dinner we all walked along the promenade getting back in time to see a very bright ISS.

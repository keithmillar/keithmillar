Spent the 12th weekend in Tollymore Forest Park with the Lyttles. Saturday we all cycled by Spelga, Silent Valley and into Newcastle stopping at the Carrick Cottage Cafe for the necessary sustenance, and if that wasn't enough ice cream in Newcastle.

 On Saturday while the girls cycled Marty and I walked up Doan and looped round to Tollymore a distance of 11 miles.

 Sunday after a late start we all walked down to the river, Lotti surprised us all with her energy, zooming back and forth between us. Weather wise this was the best day of the weekend.

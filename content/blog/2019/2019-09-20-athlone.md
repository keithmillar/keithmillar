Arrived just after 17:00 and checked into the Creggan Court Hotel. Once the others arrived we enjoyed a couple of beers and a pleasant meal.

After breakfast Flo and I walked around Athlone where we managed a coffee, then back to the hotel collected Lotti and walked her round Dun Na Si Amenity & Heritage Park. Now killing time until we eat tonight.

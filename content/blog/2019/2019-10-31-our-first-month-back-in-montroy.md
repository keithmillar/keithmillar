Only here a few days barely settled in and it Flo's Birthday 59yrs. Went to the local Pizza place to celebrate Flo's big day and Amanda and Charlott joined us and supplied the Birthday Cake. The food was VG as always. .

The weather when we arrived was very hot 36c and has remained good all month with only one days rain and one day of thunder storms with not much rain.

**2019-10-16 Bugarra.** We all went for a picnic by the river today. Watching the Fisher men with too much gear and no idea was very entertaining. Lotti had a ball even falling into the river.

**2019-10-18 Torrent Chinese.** Amanda and Charlotte picked us up at 20:00 and we arrived first. The others arrived shortly after us. Roy and Paul where back until Christmas and the reason for tonight.

This was a Chinese buffet, except it wasn't a buffet. You ordered off a menu and your order is delivered to you in no particular order, the food was quite good, just a strange concept.

**2019-10-30 Finished Cycling Goal.**
 Yesterday I reached my Oct target of 900 miles, but as I have pushed my yearly target to 7000 mile I wanted to add a few more today. Unfortunately it was blowing a hooley this morning but I decided to give it a go any way, the worst bit was from Real towards Dos Aguas after I turned back towards Montserrat the wind was mainly a cross head wind until I reached Bunol and from there it was a strong tail wind home and gave me 958 miles for the month. Really please as the 7000 is now possible.

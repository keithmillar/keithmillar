All most ready to start off for Torremolinos and it's just started raining. Stopped for a coffee and walked Lotti. I have to say the area around Almeria isn't great huge swathes of plastic greenhouses. Arrived and selected our spot in the car park set aside for campers, at least 30 vans here, some big ones. Meet with Pam and Marty and enjoyed a couple of beers and a quick catch up.

Thursday Marty and I where to go cycling however the wind was very nasty so we spent the day with Marty and Pam and walked to Benalmadena and got the train home. Joined up for a nice meal in a local restaurant.

The wind has abated some what and we where able to get out cycling very busy roads but the driving wasn't too bad and it was nice to see this part of the coast, dread to think what it must be like in the summer. Once we got back we enjoyed a couple of beers and arranged to meet later.
Mister Noodles was our choice for to night and after Pam and Marty joined us it the Irish bar, actually it turned out to be quite good.

Saturday saw us moving on to Villa Franca de Cordoba. Been here before and still a good choice a great tonic after the madness of Torremolinos. Great view of the ISS directly over head, and going out for a Brandy and coffee.

Alarcon is the detestation for tonight. Easy days driving, one stop for lunch just off the motorway. Alarcon very quiet tourists all gone and very cold.

Today Monday it's a shortish trip back to Montroy we stopped near Utiel then fuel in Bunol and home.

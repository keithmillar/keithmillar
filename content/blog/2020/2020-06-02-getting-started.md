Our first job was to Demo the kitchen, which didn't take long one concrete sink and work top, job done.

Next install a new window in the kitchen, and we quickly came up against our first problem.  The window is too big I discovered a lintel which was too low to allow the window to fit, so Flo made a trip to Bricodepo for a smaller one which we where able to fit.

We seem to be spending a lot of time and money in Ikea and Leroy Merlin these places just seem to suck the life out of you. Kitchen Units are now assembled, aligned and screwed together, worktop on and cut out for sink done. Then Flo got 2 coats of oil on the underside. I managed to fix the internal water leaks. Units now need fixing to the wall. This seemed to take forever but it's done now and the doors and drawers are all fitted so we sort of have a working kitchen.

Builders arrived and started clearing the patio and Trastero roof until the Police arrived looking for a licence so all stopped. Now we have to get a licence god knows how log that will take, and we also have to get another company to remove the roof.

We hired a van to remove all the crap from the house and took it all to the dump and moved all our wood from Naama's to the new house. Of course hiring the van turned out more difficult than expected, due to Covid Enterprise move the vans to the center of Valencia luckily we discovered this on the way to the airport, so I dropped Flo off and she got the metro into the city and collected the van.

Today 30th June we leave Naama's and move to Real. Eddy has been packed and after a pizza we are off we will spend the next few nights in Eddy as we have no bed yet, naturally this coincides with a really hot spell.

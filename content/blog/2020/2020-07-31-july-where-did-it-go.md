Finished off in the bathroom installed a vanity unit and a shower, the vanity united caused some problems as it need to be off the wall as the pipe work had to pass behind it . Getting a working shower was fantastic.

 **2020-07-06 Big Day Today my Birthday** and more importantly our Solar equipment arrived, on two pallets, the driver was able to drop them right at the front door luckily for us as there are eight batteries each weighing 57kg now the fun begins.

Flo took us to L'Antic Meso for a birthday lunch food was very good, a break with tradition as we normally go to Daft Eddys.

Amanda and Charlotte aided by Flo did a massive tidy up in the garden.

After more delays with the roof and not having a fridge we decided to go ahead and install the Solar system, only using six of the nine panels and putting them on the ground at the back of the house. The Solar was quite easy to do being a kit it was mainly a matter of mounting the solar controller / inverter on the wall connecting the batteries and finally the Solar panels.

**2020-07-19 Solar Power.** We generating our own electricity.
Now it's just a matter of wiring the house sockets and installing the earth rods and we should be good to go. The earth rods where a bit of a bastard to get in but we got there in the end unfortunately no earth at the sockets. (the lack of an earth has resolved itself)

**2020-07-25 21:30 Dinner & Jazz @ Salon Campos.** Lovely surroundings and very good food if a bit rushed the music didn't start until after the meal and it was a bit insipid still a lovely evening.

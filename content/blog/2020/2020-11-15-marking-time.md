Just doing as many jobs as possible, but the weather is awful and since Lotti got the ok from the vet we have decided to return to Spain if possible.

We managed to tidy the back garden, clean the fascia and replace the bathroom radiator.

Flo is pissed not being able to visit friends and family or go anywhere, the weather is crap no fun walking or cycling so we might as well try and get back to Real where we can get some jobs done.

We have got a lot done this month although it doesn't always seem that way, we finally got our car after a lot of messing around the dealer was very good and in the end Flo had to visit Requena and show her NIE. Now we have to wait for the original paper work before we can get the tow bar validated, this will involve 3 trips to the ITV near Aldaia.

Svint installed Internet Wifi which allowed use to paint the front of the house and move the TV arial on to their pole and move the cable, small jobs but they do make a difference.

We also managed a train trip into Valencia for a hoof around. The city was very quite with lots of closed Bars and Shops, even around the Nativity Scene it was lacking people.

We went out on a re con looking for new roads, it was quite successful as we found a good loop to Catadau and back.

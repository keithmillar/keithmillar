Finally feels like we are making some progress, tiled the kitchen and installed a new bathroom window and the last cupboard door became available in Ikea which allowed us to finish the kitchen cabinets.

At long last C M Nagar gave us a date when he will put up the patio. Pepe & Aaron arrived on the 15th and the patio is now in place.

Table and 2 benches reserved for the patio from the second hand shop in Montroy have been collected and are now in place, I think they look fantastic.

Removed the old bathroom window to replace it with a nice new tilt and turn window which lets in much more light.

Heavy rain all day, but we had arranged lunch with Amanda and Charlotte in Montserrat. Then we remembered tomorrow is a holiday and we need wood, went and collected that near Godaletta.

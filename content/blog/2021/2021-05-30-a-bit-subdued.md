Our first night out since the curfew was introduced. Amanda and Charlott joined us for some grub in Blanc i Negre in Montserrat. Good food and company just scraped back home before curfew. 

Temperature over 30c first Time this year, not before time cold and damp since late Jan.

2021-05-20 Covid injection one done.

Removed old shower tray and filled hole with cement using our new mixer.

Fitted new shower tray, and removed half the floor tiles and layed new tiles on this half before removing toilet and remaining floor tiles then we layed the last tiles (not without some difficulty) and grouted the floor.

Install toilet and rerouted waste pipes, some small adjustments needed before gluing.

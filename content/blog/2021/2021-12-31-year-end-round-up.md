More of the same, everything still up in the air due to covid. Travel very limited so we have stayed local since our return in July/August.

I suppose we have managed with minimal disruption and have worked away at the house and our now in the position to decide when to do certain job instead of being dictated by the work. Worst affected where Garth and Helena with no travel work and intermittent closing of the shop 

Seeing as it's Christmas we went into Valencia for a hoof around nice day and good grub in Romeo and Giulietta.

A first for us Christmas dinner in La Porton very nice just the two of us as C&A contracted Covid.

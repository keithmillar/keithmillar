This turned out to be a month of changes. Flo was due to go home meet up with some friends and then travel to Rosslare and meet Cath, Frank and Louise. That was until Kathleen died on Monday 7th at 14:00.

Fiona had previously contacted me saying Kathleen was very ill and not expected to last for only a couple more day's. So it wasn't completely unexpected.

Fortunately I was able to get booked on the same flight as Flo and we travelled Home together via Dublin for the Funeral on Thursday.

On Saturday we visited Fiona and Mark and where introduced to Trader, Lisa and Kyle's dog a young puppy which will test Fiona over the course of the next 3 weeks.

Then we visited the McCosh's for the first time it was just Flo and I, no Perry's nice to talk one on one Surprisingly frank conversation With Michael about his family.

We finished the shed and then tiled the floor, just getting the floor finished before the rains set in. The tiles made such a difference when it rains, before the floor flooded, with the tiles the floor stays dry with a couple of small dribbles coming in near the house. To finish off the shed we bought a work bench from Bauhaus built it and installed it, great job lots of Stuff now organised.

Luckly we completed the shed just before the rain arrived on the 16th and it only stopped raining on Sunday 27th according to Aemet it is the wettest March since 1948

 On the plus side I bought a new Turntable Audio-Technica AT-LPILOX use the idea is to bring my LP's out to Spain and digitise them. We bought a couple of records in Fnac for testing purposes the sound is pretty good, next we will try copying them to the PC.  

Amanda and Charlotte suggested going to see The Batman movie in Heron City great Theatre sound very good and the movie was good if very long. After the film we dinned in Tommy Mels which was enjoyable even when the waiter tried to throw our drinks over us.  

Flo flew to London for a girly weekend with her two sisters, she couldn't have picked a better weekend as the weather here was abysmal Torrential rain.

Sunday 27th was the first day I could go out I opted for a short walk, its been quite annoying as I had been building up my cycling nicely with longer hilly rides it is now 17 days with no cycling.

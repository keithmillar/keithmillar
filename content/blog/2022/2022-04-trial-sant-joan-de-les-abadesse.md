 On good Friday we drove to Camprodon in Girona to meet with Kenny and his Partner Andrew for a 3 day trial in Sant Joan de les Abadesse. We stayed in the hotel Puig Franc√≥ owned by a trials enthusiastic, so the hotel has a trials theme all the rooms are named after famous riders and loads of motor cycle pictures adorned the walls.

 We had a great time with Ken and Andrew drinking and eating too much and great crack. Saturday evening Toni Bau and Fuji Nama put on a display on the last section very impressive. 
 
 Sunday and we all decided to see some of the local scenery we drove to Mollo and found restaurant Hostel Panoramix good food served by a very proud son who's mother was the chief. 
 
 On the way home on Monday we called to Girona to see Earl and Gina who where just finishing a cycling holiday. We got a coffee and heard all about their holiday great catch up.

Flo treated me to a birth day lunch in the Indian in Torrent which was spot on as usual. The show in Real does not start until 22:00 this gave us time for a rest before we set out again. Seat cost 1â‚¬ we found our seats and bought some bear as we didn't know to bring our own and at midnight the musical began. The show was the history of musicals some famous world wide, some peculiar to Spain a good day all round.

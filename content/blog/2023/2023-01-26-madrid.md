 Our first trip trip to Madrid, leaving from Valencia Joaquin Sorolla station on the high speed train great way to travel clean, roomy and fast.

 Getting around was super easy on the metro, and number 1 and 2 buses which are free for tourists and being a big city things tented to be spread out so the transport was needed.

 Our Ibis Hotel was quite central and beside it was a fantastic taps bar where I got a fabulous scrambled egg and morcilla dish.

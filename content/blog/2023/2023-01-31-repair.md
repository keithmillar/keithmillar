During or recent trip to Madrid we passed this shop selling all types of springs, later the same day we found a shop for leather workers selling everything from hide to tiny grommets, pliers, cutters and punches the list goes on. On our last day I found an arcade with 6 to 8 clock / watch shops again selling everything from watches , batteries, faces, glass iand tools to fit glass and many thing I could not identify. Never seen the like back home, looks to me like the Spanish repair stuff. Even back in Real it's easy to get parts for things, we could learn from this back home.

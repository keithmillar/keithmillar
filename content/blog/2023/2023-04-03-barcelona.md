Enjoyed the city immensity lots of walking around the Olympic Park and Tibidabo great views and reform using the Funicular.

lots of food & drink, really enjoyed the Japanese. Ken and Andrew are great host.

On a visit to the football stadium I bought my first Barca Tee shirt.

Short trim trip ended all too soon but Once again, the train was the way to go if a bit long on the way back but we made all our connections.

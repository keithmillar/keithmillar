On our way to get some wood in Godelleta, We spotted a couple of cyclists at the side of the road with what appeared to be a small puppy.  We turned the car around to see if we could offer any assistance. The girl said that they found the puppy, in a drain at the side of the road, being on bikes they could do little for the dog so we offered to to look after him.

He lay at my feel on the way home very confused and frightened, once home it be apparent that he was under nourished and covered in ticks and fleas, we quickly got an appointment with the vet in Montroy, She gave him a pill for the ticks and fleas and some special food to aid with his recovery.

The drugs did their magic and the ticks began to die and we removed all the body's Woody is eating well and with luck on the road to recovery . Once he settles in we will bath him and clean his ear's which where full of ticks.  Needless to say we never got the wood.

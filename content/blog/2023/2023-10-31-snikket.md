Snikket could be the perfect message and phone app for me, and my close family.  I bought a virtual raspberry pi from [www.mythic-beasts.com](https://www.mythic-beasts.com) just for the purpose of running snikket but it is not to be.

Once I worked around the letsencrypt issue and I could do admin via the web interface no amount of poking could get mobile or desktop apps Go connect.

To see if the problem was me I Spun up a vm on linode and snikket worked out of the box. It was also very good quality for phone calls even from Garth in Canada, message where excellent, just the cost of the vm was too much such an app with limited users.

The problem with [www.mythic-beasts.com](https://www.mythic-beasts.com) and raspberry pi I suspect is ipv6 and I don't have a work around.

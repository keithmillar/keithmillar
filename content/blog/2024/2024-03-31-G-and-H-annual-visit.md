Garth and Helena end their annual visit in a couple of days when they fly back to Canada. 
We packed a lot in, two big cycles one with Sara Wager which was a great day on the bikes and a great Indian meal at the end.

Garth also helped me remove a huge tree root when we took down the collapsing wall, getting it out of the ground was hard enough but getting it to the Echo Visi and into a skip was nearly as hard, in fact it took the two of us and a local builder was kind enough to helped.

Garth and Helena spent several days in Valencia checking hotels and securing marathon slots for the forth coming event in December.

Well, July has been a bit of a boring month really. Since the Town decided not to celebrate my birthday this year we went to pizzeria Il Birbone, where once again we had an excellent meal. Flo bought me an lovely Polar watch.

Thursday 11th the big show in Real's Fiesta this year was an Abba tribute band, which was quite good and it was free. As in previous years people watching was the best sport of the evening

We received a surprising phone call from the window manufacturer to say he would be delivering the windows tonight (Tuesday 16th ) and the builder will be out the next day to install the windows. So three days later we have two new windows installed, one in the living room and one in the bedroom.

Asador City Wok was where we met up with Sarah and Steve for our lunch and a chat. Good afternoon, and food was quite good.

Prior to lunch we did some shopping in Leroy Merlin where we purchased some curtains and curtain rails for the new bedroom window and after a rest Flo and I put them up.

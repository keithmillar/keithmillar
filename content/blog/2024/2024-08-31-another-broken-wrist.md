Sunday 4th and Flo planned a route for our coffee ride which turned out to be quite hard, as it turned out a little too hard in one place, near Alborache I failed to make the climb and came to an abrupt halt leaving Flo no space to pass, grinding to a halt her self she toppled over breaking her right wrist. After the initial shock and a little panic as we where a long way from a road and not sure of our exact location, we regrouped and walked to ridable trail and Flo was able to cycle to the medical center in Turis where she waited for me to get the car and take her to hospital to have the wrist x-rayed and the bake confirmed.

Luckily Flo was able to fly home for her Sister and Brother in Laws 50th Wedding Anniversary.

I also managed to fall off my bike at broken bridge, fortunately with only a couple of scrapes.

October got under way quietly I caught a nasty cold which got into my chest and lingered for most of the month.

An early highlight was Flo's birthday to celebrate We booked a table in La Font the place was buzzing and the food was very good, being a Saturday the whole world was on show.

Lunched with Sarah and Steve at the little Thai in Torrent, and Sarah was telling us about her plans for some long distance rides next year, we arranged to meet at the Honey Festival in Montroy next month.

Flo rescued a little kitten on Sunday it survived the night but the Vet euthanize it on Monday, we have stopped feeding the cats since London as there is just too many.

After our Covid and Flu jabs we bought the paint for the living room, and on the way home I spotted some poles in the second hand shop that we can use to make raised beds, bought 12 enough for 3 beds.

Rotavator would not run so we took it to Totmoto after a week we got it back and I did the rear garden so we can start building the raised beds.

Flo finally got a MRI appointment which of course was on a lovely cycling day.

All good until the morning of the 29th when the heavens opened and we got rain like never before. It continued all day rain and thunder, around 18:00 the Internet and phones went down. The rest is history massive flooding and damage all around us.

Wednesday morning and we went into Real to see if we could get phone or Internet, only then we discovered the true scale of the damaged.  The Rio Magio was a raging torrent taking all in it's path, over 210 people are dead with many more missing and Hundreds homeless, 100,000 cars damage or destroyed, roads and bridges wrecked or wiped out. Trains and Metro are off and will be for weeks to come. The A3 and A7 are closed to traffic. 

Our neighbours Gary and Marion were badly hit and we spent most of Monday shovelling mud from the house, driveway and garage. Shows now lucky Flo and I where.

It will take the Provence of Valencia years to fully recover from this

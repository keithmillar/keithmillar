 We Drove up to Emporda on the Costa Brava to join Ken,Andrew, Andy and Gareth plus their partners for the Two Day Classic Trial. Great to catch up with everyone Andy and Gareth I haven't seen for several years. 
 The trail was good but the fact it was a Classic Trial made it special, these are the bikes I competed on for years, Red Bultacos, Fantic 240, Yamaha TY250 and loads more. The icing on the cake for me was the Kawasaki KT250 only one, but this was my first trials bike.
 What we a=saw of the trial was very good, ridable sections well marked out. There was also a large cross section of riders some well known faces from the past and a good complement of women.

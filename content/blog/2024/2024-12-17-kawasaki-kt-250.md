 My First Trials bike was a Kawasaki KT 250, in fact it was my first motor bike ever. I managed to Convince my Dad to lend me the Â£190 I needed to buy It from Ricky McKenna who lived round the Corner from our house in Ballywalter.  Turned out to be a great little bike and would be the start of my trials riding.
This all came back to me after the 2 day trial near Girona, sitting at section was a heavily modified Kawasaki KT 250 with slimmed down Seat and Tank unit.  Once home a google Search reviled pictures of the original bike as I remembered it with it's distinctive green tank. Great bike and the start of many friend ships and even a wife.

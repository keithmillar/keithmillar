Late on Thursday 10th we went up to Shirley & Mario's to look after the dogs until Monday 10th,
We got Wood delivered from a place just outside the town a bit expensive worth it as in burns hotter and longer. Done some niggle jobs like the handle on the bathroom door and the pavers levelled and glued.

Pissed about the car needing fuel the fuel tank drained and cleaned 300â‚¬ causing me to miss a cycle near Gandia, although I heard later that it was cancelled due to heavy rain and cold.

 Flo's sprocket wasn't ordered and the gravel bike wouldn't be available until June so we decided it would better to sell the Urrun and get something more appropriate looks like she has settled on a BH. Heading off on Friday for a weekend near Barcelona before we collect G&H.

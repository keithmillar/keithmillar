As we where coming to Barcelona to collect Garth & Helena it seemed like good idea to make it a long weekend Flo booked us into a lovely hotel in Cunit.
 On Saturday we went to Barcelona for the day, tunnel works lead to a bus substitution service and a total mess of trains especially on the way back late and jammed solid standing room only. Carnival was on which added to the kayos.

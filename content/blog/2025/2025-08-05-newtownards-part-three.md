Back to Victoria Crescent once again this time on my own. Flew into Cork and Karen collected me at the airport. Next day I collected a van and drove up Newtownards.

Made good time so I checked into the hotel, once this was done I drove over to the house where I proceeded to load the van with the last things we wanted and did a tidy up inside and out,this took less time than anticipated, rang May and she was free I called with her and enjoyed an evening catching up.

Thursday and my eye test was cancelled, rang Marty but he was away, nothing else for headed back to Cork taking my time, once Karen arrive back I unloaded the van.

Friday I returned the van and spent a morning around Cork still thriving although quite this morning. Back at Karen's I sorted the boxes for Spain and when Judy arrived home we all went out for a pint.

Saturday Karen and I went for a coffee in Kinsale then she dropped me at the airport.

House is now on the market.

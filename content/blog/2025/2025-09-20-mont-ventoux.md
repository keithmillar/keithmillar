Our trip got off to a shaky start after a pleasant day in Caldes de Malavell (the home of Vichy Catalan Water) Freya pissed in her bed, major cleaning operation ensued old bed binned and new one purchased in the nearest China Shop.

Once we left Caldes de Malavell the weather turned really bad we kept driving into thunder storms and hold ups on the motorway.

We arrive in Malaucène to more rain but the airbnb seems OK, until the electric went off, David the owner fixed asap. Over night Freya pissed her bed and crapped in the living room being in an apartment it was easer to clean up.

Surprise still raining this morning heavy too. Drove to Vision for supplies, the skies cleared out came the Sun and we where able to sit outside for coffee and cake, must say Woody and Freya are very good at coffee stops and generally wait patiently.

Tue 23 Finally got to cycle Mont Ventoux not a bad climb fairly even grade with the last 2k being the hardest. The climb starts in Bedouin this being the side that the Tour de France uses, once leaving the village the terrain is open and not too steep shortly we turn left into the forest and the gradient starts to ramp up. Due to the recent rain many places had stone and mud washed on to the road other wise the surface was good. On reaching Chalet Reynard the trees give way to barren rock and the gradient starts to tell. Great to see such a vast array of ability and loads of electric bikes enabling many to cycle this mountain who other wise wouldn't be able to. The descent should have been good but I was too cold to make the best of it finding it difficult to stop shaking causing the bike shake violently. Unfortunately the weather was nasty the next day and I was unable to climb from the Malaucène side and redo the descent.

After leaving Malaucène we stayed in Aparthotel Can Gallart in Santa Coloma de Farners nice hotel. Spent most of the day trying to get Freya to pee. Watched the fire brigade putting out a fire in a fun fair.

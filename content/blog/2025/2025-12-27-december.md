December has been a real winter month this year very cold, wet and windy.
Very few outside jobs, just rotovated the garden a couple of days after the rain when the ground was just right.

We did a few things around the house such as shelving and lights we where able to use the shades from home in the living room and bedrooms.

I have done ok on the cycling front In spite of the weather one more short ride will get me to six thousand for the year, even felt the need for an hour on the rollers.

Highlight of the month was our annual trip to Valencia to see the crib although the market was a bit poor.

We where invited for lunch on Christmas day with our Dutch neighbours turned out better than expected.

Solar system has been somewhat stressed by the lack of sun, something we will look at when we sell the house in N.I.
